## Introduction

This is a project of real-time multiple object tracking in person re-identification. The proposal is to re-design the Re-ID model by having a separable generative and discriminative network. The baseline is a Yolov5 based DeepSort tracker and can be found [here](https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch).
